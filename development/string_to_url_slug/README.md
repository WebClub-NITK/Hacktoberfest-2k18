# String to url
## Description
Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled "How to use Github", it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (".../how-to-use-github").

Write a function in Javascript such that it converts a string ``title`` and returns the hyphenated version for the URL.

## How to
Include ``string_to_url_slug.js`` in your html page and use the ``string_to_url_slug(title)`` javascript function to get the hyphenated version of the title, an example is provided in the ``example.html`` file
